# Projet_IA
This is the final evaluation project for the AI course, completed by Tom LERO and Louis STOVEN. The project incorporates two different AI approaches to create chatbots - one utilizing OpenAI's ChatGPT API, and the other with PyTorch.

## Chatbot 1: ChatGPT Chatbot
This chatbot utilizes the OpenAI's ChatGPT API. It's integrated with a conversational interface to facilitate interactions focused on cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and SOL with your own dataset.

## Chatbot 2: Pytorch Chatbot
This chatbot uses PyTorch to build a contextual chatbot from scratch.
